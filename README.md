# mapDB
Example of mapDB and JSoup.

It takes stock values from https://www.google.com/finance and stores into file database.

StockQuote.java is from http://www.cs.princeton.edu and created by Professor Sedgewick and Wayne. I modified little bit. In.java is created by me.

Trying to make a stock based application using jsoup, mapdb and google finance.
